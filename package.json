  "description": "This project is a mobile-friendly Pokémon browser built with Ionic and Angular using the public RESTful service PokeAPI. I followed a component-based architecture to keep the code modular and scalable. Each feature was split into services, components, and views to maintain a clear separation of concerns. I applied dependency injection for managing API services and shared state, ensuring testability and flexibility. Clean, reusable code was prioritized using TypeScript best practices and strong typing. For styling, I used Tailwind CSS, which allowed for fast and responsive UI development. The application includes routing between screens using Angular Router, with dynamic routes for Pokémon details. A local favorites system was implemented using localStorage to persist data. Pagination was added to improve usability and performance. Commits were made regularly with clear messages to document progress and changes effectively."
